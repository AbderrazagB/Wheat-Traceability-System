## Usage

    Make sure you have node version 18 or higher activated (some dependencies will not work if not).
    
    Run yarn install to download all the dependencies.

    Then run ' node --loader ts-node/esm server.ts ' to start the server.

    You can test the functions using Post Man http requests.
